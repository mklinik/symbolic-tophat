When a task has an observable value, we consider it done.
Tasks only have an observable value when they consist merely of editors or pairs of editors.
At this point, user interaction with the task can change its value, but it is impossible for the task to do anything meaningful with that new value.
This is the point where symbolic execution terminates.



\begin{definition}[Satisfiability of predicates]
  \label{def:Sat}
  $\Sat(\phi)$ if and only if there exits a mapping $M=[s_0\mapsto c_0,\cdots,s_n\mapsto c_n]$ such that $M\phi\equiv\True$
\end{definition}
