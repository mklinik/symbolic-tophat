**A symbolic execution semantics for TopHat **

1)

Workflow systems are all around us.
	They manage processes, people, machines and information
	Behind me you see some places where workflow systems are used.
	The dutch coastal guard
	Hospital workflow software developer ChipSoft
	The dutch tax office
	The Netherlands royal navy.
They all have the need for better workflow software, both in the way they are developed, and the quality of the applications themselves.


2)

For many years, our team, lead by Rinus Plasmeijer, has been working on exactly that.


3)

So what are workflow applications?
	Users working together
	Their work is structured in some way (parallel, sequential, choice, etc)
	There is a representation of a system in data that is manipulated by the work done by the users

Our efforts over the years lead to a new way of programming applications.

4)

We call this Task Oriented programming.
The idea is that the smallest amounts of work, called editors, are combined using some combinator language, into tasks.
Tasks can manipulate global data, pass along data, and interact with users.

The advantage is that programmers only need to define what work needs to be done in which way. The rest of the application is deduced from this specification.


5)
If you’ve seen iTasks, then this all sounds familiar to you.
In my research, I’m looking for ways in which we can further enhance the quality of Task Oriented Programming applications.

5.a)

To this end, my colleagues Tim Steenvoorden, Markus Klinik and I have developed the TopHat programming language.
This language is a formal foundation for TOP, that allows us to apply formal methods to programs.
The publication is to appear at ppdp'19 in a few weeks.

For the rest of this talk,
	I will first introduce the TOPHAT language,
	Then we will take a look at an example program
	After which, I will explain what symbolic execution is, for those who don't know
	Then we will look at how this technique can be applied to TOPHAT.
	We'll revisit the example,
	After which I will conclude.

6)

To give you a sense of how the language works, I will show you part of its syntax, and an example program.
TopHat is embedded in a simply typed lambda calculus with references.
Editors are the basic elements of the task layer. They can hold a value, be empty, or refer to a shared location.
There are three kinds of combinators available; Step, Parallel, Choice.

Let us take a look at a small example.
We’ve developed this example together with the dutch tax office.
In the Netherlands, it is possible to get a subsidy when you install solar panels on the roof of your home.
There are a few requirements;
	You need to apply within 365 days
	Confirmation from the installation company is required
	A tax officer needs to approve the application
	The subsidy is at most 600 euros

We’ve defined the following program.
	(go over the code)

Now, when we consider this program, we were wondering, how can we be sure that this code adheres to the requirements mentioned before?
We could provide test input, and check that the outcome is correct.
Writing test cases is a lot of work, and even then we are not certain that the code always works correct; we could have overlooked a case.
Random testing then perhaps? Then again, we have no guarantee that all cases are covered.

In order to prove TopHat programs correct, we employ symbolic execution.
The idea is that instead of running a program on concrete input, you execute it on symbolic input.
Consider the program excerpt on the left.
	We have x,y
	then conditional
	then either y or x
We do not know the value of x and y beforehand.
Instead we record path conditions for each branch.

***** this part needs some work!!!! ******


This technique comes from imperative programming.

How do we apply this to TopHat?

	Add symbols to expressions in the simply typed lamda calculus & inputs
	Add path conditions to syntax
	Add typing rule for symbls
	combine if rules and combine pick rules
	pass path conditions along
	handle editor with symbols
	add simulate function
 Allright, now how does this work for our tax example?

First, we formulate the property that we want to prove:
	(1) subsidy larger than zero only if confirmed by the company and
	(2) subsidy larger than zero only if approved by the tax office and
	(3) approval by tax office, only when company confirmed and
	(and) the invoice date should be within one year of todays date and
	(4) the subsidy amount should never be larger than 600 and
	(5) the subsidy is zero if tax office did not approve

Then, we run the symbolic execution on the task.
This results in a set of all symbolic executions.

In order to verify that all runs adhere to the predicate, we show that in each case, our predicate holds.


We have validated our approach to prove soundness and completeness for the symbolic execution semantics.

For completeness, this means that every concrete execution must be contained in a symbolic execution.
For soundness, this means that every symbolic execution can be mapped to a concrete execution by substituting the symbols for concrete values.


As I said in the beginning of this presentation, our goal is to improve both the development and the quality of workflow applications.
Applying symbolic execution in order to show that certain properties hold, is one small step in the big picture.

As far as symbolic execution goes, we feel that we haven’t used its full potential for Task Oriented Programming yet.
Currently, our symbolic execution only considers the resulting task value. We would like to be able to take input into account as well.
Secondly, we would like to see if we can apply symbolic execution not only to TOPHAT, but also too iTasks.
And third, we are currently working on the application of symbolic execution as a means to assist users when execution workflows. Symbolic execution can be used to calculate what next step a user should take, in order to come closer to some goal state.

And apart from symbolic execution, there are many more ideas on how we can improve quality and development of workflow systems.
On the software analysis side, many questions remain. When are two tasks equal? And what does it mean when two tasks are equal? Can a certain part of a task be reached? Can we prove properties to hold at every point in the program?
Many tasks in real life require recourses, like people, fuel and time. Can we calculate how much a task would use when we execute it?

On the development side, our colleagues are currently investigating how to apply the Task Oriented Programming paradigm to embedded systems.
There have also been efforts in the past to program tasks visually.

All in all, Task oriented programming is a very interesting area of research, of which symbolic execution forms an interesting step.
