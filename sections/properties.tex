\section{Properties}
\label{sec:properties}

In this section, we describe what it means for the symbolic execution semantics to be correct.
We demonstrate it to be sound and complete with respect to the original semantics of \TOPHAT.
% Furthermore, we demonstrate that the pruning performed in Section~\ref{subsec:driving} is safe,
% and only removes branches that are either unfeasible, or infinite.

% \subsection{Removal of Not SAT}
%
% Subsection~\ref{subsec:driving} describes two criteria that are used to prune away branches of the symbolic execution.
% The first removes branches that result in a predicate that is not satisfiable.
% As stated in Definition~\ref{def:Sat}, this means that there is no substitution for the symbols in the predicate,
% that will make the predicate true.
%
% In other words, these symbolic branches have no counterpart in the concrete semantics, and are therefore invalid.
% This property is described in the following theorem.
%
% \begin{theorem}[Not sat is safe to remove]
%   \label{thm:notSat}
%
% For all tasks $t$ and states $\sigma$ such that
% $t,\sigma\drive{}\overline{t',\sigma',i,\phi}$\quad
% $t',\sigma'\drive{}\overline{t'',\sigma'',i',\phi'}$
%
% we have that $\neg\text{SAT }(\phi\land\phi')$ implies
% that there is no mapping $M=[s_0\mapsto c_0,\cdots,s_n\mapsto c_n]$ such that
% $t,M\sigma\xrightarrow[]{Mi}\bar{t'},\bar{\sigma'}\xrightarrow[]{Mi'}\bar{t''},\bar{\sigma''}$
%
% \end{theorem}
%
% The proof for this theorem is listed in the appendix.
%
% It is important to note that this holds for all future states of the unsatisfiable symbolic executions too.
% This can be concluded from the way in which the predicates are constructed, new predicates are put in conjunction with the old one.
%
% %%%%%%%%% STUCK properties  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% \subsection{When are branches stuck?}
%
% The second pruning criteria deals with terms that allow for infinite input streams,
% but that will not result in a value.
%
% Observe the following small program. $\Edit 1 \Next \lambda x . \Edit x + 1$.
%
% The symbolic execution will tell us that we can do one of two things;
% send a new symbolic value to the editor, or we can send $\Continue$,
% to proceed to the right hand side of the expression.
%
% When we elect the first, sending a new symbolic value, we can then again send yet another
% symbolic value to the editor. And then again, and again and again.
%
% No extra information is gained, $s_0$ and $s_1$ are erased from the program, and are not contained in the state or
% predicate.
%
% \begin{lemma}[Stuck really is stuck]
% For all tasks $t$ and states $\sigma$ such that $t,\sigma \handle{i} t',\sigma',\phi$,
% then $t=t'$ and $\phi=\phi'$ implies that there is no step $t',\sigma'\handle{i'} t'',\sigma'',\phi'$ such that either $t'\neq t''$ or $\phi\neq\phi'$.
% \label{lemma:stuck}
% \end{lemma}
% \fixme{$\phi'$ is not in scope on the left side of the implication.}
% \\
% \fixme{this cannot be proven untill the drive function is fixed}

In order to relate the two semantics, we use the of concrete inputs listed in Figure~\ref{fig:inputsConcrete}.

\subsection{Soundness}




%For completeness and soundness we define what it means to completely evaluate a task, given a list of concrete inputs.

% \begin{function}
%   \signature{\mathit{eval} :: \Task \times [\textrm{Concrete inputs}] \times \mathrm{State} \rightarrow \Task \times \mathrm{State}} \\
%   \mathit{eval}\ t\ (j:js)\ \sigma = \begin{array}{ll}
%                               (t',\sigma')      & \Value(t',\sigma') \equiv v \\
%                               \mathit{eval}\ t'\ \sigma' & \Value(t',\sigma') \equiv \bot
%                                   \end{array}
%                               \textrm{with } t,s\xrightarrow[]{j} t',\sigma'
% \end{function}

% \begin{theorem}[Soundness of symbolic execution]
% \label{thm:sound}
%
% For all tasks $t$, mappings $M=[s_0\mapsto c_0,\cdots,s_n\mapsto c_n]$,
% for all elements $(t',I,\sigma,\phi)\in \mathit{drive}\ t\ [\ ]\ \emptyset\ \True$,
% $M \phi\equiv\True$ implies
% $eval\ t\ (M I)\ \emptyset=(t_n,\sigma_n)$,  $t_n=M t'$ and $\sigma_n=M \sigma$.
% \end{theorem}
% \fixme{this cannot be proven untill the drive function is fixed}

In order to validate the symbolic execution semantics, we want to show that for every symbolic execution, there exists a corresponding concrete one.
This soundness property is expressed by Theorem~\ref{thm:sounddrive}.

\begin{theorem}[Soundness of driving]
  \label{thm:sounddrive}

  For all tasks $t$, states $\sigma$ and mappings $M=[s_0\mapsto c_0,\cdots,s_n\mapsto c_n]$,
  such that $t,\sigma\drive{} \overline{t',\sigma',i,\phi}$
  we have $M\phi$ implies
  $t,\sigma M \xRightarrow[]{M i} t'',\sigma''$, $t'M \equiv t''$ and $\sigma' M \equiv \sigma''$.
\end{theorem}

The proof for this lemma is rather straightforward.
Since the driving semantics makes use of the handling and the normalisation semantics, we require two lemmas.
One showing that the handling semantics is sound, Lemma~\ref{lem:soundhandle}, and one showing that the normalisation semantics is sound, Lemma~\ref{lem:soundnorm}.

\begin{lemma}[Soundness of handling]
  \label{lem:soundhandle}

  For all tasks $t$, states $\sigma$ and mappings $M = [s_0\mapsto c_0,\cdots,s_n\mapsto c_n]$,
  such that $t,\sigma\handle{i} \overline{t',\sigma',\phi}$,
  we have $\phi M = \True$ implies
  $t,M \sigma \xrightarrow[]{M i} t'',\sigma''$, $t'M \equiv t'' $ and $\sigma' M \equiv \sigma''$
\end{lemma}

Lemma~\ref{lem:soundhandle} is proven by induction over $t$.
The full proof is listed in the appendix.

\begin{lemma}[Soundness of normalisation]
  \label{lem:soundnorm}

  For all expressions $e$, states $\sigma$ and mappings $M=[s_0\mapsto c_0,\cdots,s_n\mapsto c_n]$,
  such that $e,\sigma\normalise \overline{t,\sigma',\phi}$,
  we have $\phi M =\True$ implies
  $e,M \sigma \bar{\normalise}t',\sigma''$, $t M \equiv t'$ and $\sigma' M \equiv \sigma''$.

\end{lemma}

Since Lemma~\ref{lem:soundnorm} makes use of both the striding and the evaluation semantics,
we are required to show soundness for those too.

\begin{lemma}[Soundness of striding]
  \label{lem:soundstride}

  For all tasks $t$, states $\sigma$ and mappings $M=[s_0\mapsto c_0,\cdots,s_n\mapsto c_n]$,
  such that $t,\sigma\stride \overline{t',\sigma',\phi}$,
  $M \phi= \True$ implies
  $t,M\sigma \bar{\stride}\bar{t'},\bar{\sigma'}$, $M t'\ \equiv \bar{t'} \land M\sigma' \equiv \bar{\sigma'}$.

\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}[Soundness of evaluation]
  \label{lem:soundeval}

  For all expressions $e$, states $\sigma$ and mappings $M=[s_0\mapsto c_0,\cdots,s_n\mapsto c_n]$,
  such that $e,\sigma\eval \overline{v,\sigma',\phi}$,
  we have that $M\phi \implies t,M\sigma \bar{\eval}\bar{v},\bar{\sigma'} \land Mv \equiv \bar{v} \wedge M\sigma' \equiv \bar{\sigma'}$.

\end{lemma}

The full proof of \cref{lem:soundnorm,lem:soundstride,lem:soundeval} are listed in the appendix.





\subsection{Completeness}

We also want to show that for every concrete execution, a symbolic one exists.
This completeness property is listed in Theorem~\ref{thm:completeDrive}.

% \begin{theorem}[Completeness of symbolic execution]
% For all tasks $t$ and input lists $[j_0,\cdots,j_n]$ such that $\mathit{eval}\ t\ [j_0,\cdots,j_n]\ \emptyset = (t',\sigma')$,
% then there exists an element $(t'',I,\sigma'',\phi'')\in \mathit{drive}\ t\ [\ ]\ \emptyset\ \True$ and mapping $[s_0\mapsto c_0,\cdots,s_n\mapsto c_n]$ such that
% $I[s_0\mapsto c_0,\cdots,s_n\mapsto c_n]=[j_0,\cdots,j_n]$ and $t'=t''[s_0\mapsto c_0,\cdots,s_n\mapsto c_n]$.
%   \label{thm:complete}
% \end{theorem}
%
% \fixme{Proof of thm 5.2 is required for this thm}

\begin{theorem}[Completeness of driving]
  \label{thm:completeDrive}
  $\forall t,\sigma,j$ such that $t,\sigma \xRightarrow[]{j} t',\sigma'$
  there exists an $i\sim j$ such that $t,\sigma''\drive{i} t'',\sigma''',\phi$.
\end{theorem}

Where with $i\sim j$ we mean that the symbolic input $i$ follows the same direction as the concrete input does.
This relation is properly defined below.

\begin{definition}[input simulation]
  A symbolic input $i$ simulates a concrete input $j$ denoted as $i\sim j$ in the following cases.\\
  $s\sim a$, where $s$ is a symbol and $a$ a concrete action.\\
  $i\sim j\implies \First i \sim \First j$\\
  $i\sim j\implies \Second i \sim \Second j$
\end{definition}

The proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:completeDrive} is rather simple.
We show that handling is complete, Lemma~\ref{lem:completeHandle},
and that the subsequent normalisation is complete too, Lemma~\ref{lem:completeNormalise}.


\begin{lemma}[Completeness of handling]
  \label{lem:completeHandle}
  $\forall t,\sigma,j$ such that $t,\sigma \xrightarrow[]{j} t',\sigma'$
  there exists an $i\sim j$ such that $t,\sigma''\handle{i} t'',\sigma''',\phi$.
\end{lemma}

Lemma~\ref{lem:completeHandle} is shown by induction over $t$.
In essence, we merely need to show that every concrete execution also is a symbolic one.
The only change needed to convert from concrete to symbolic, is the adaption of the input.

Since handling makes use of the normalisation, striding and eventually the evaluation semantics,
we need to prove that they too are complete.
These properties are listed in \cref{lem:completeNormalise,lem:completeStride,lem:completeEval}

\begin{lemma}[Completeness of normalisation]
  \label{lem:completeNormalise}
  $\forall e,\sigma$ such that $e,\sigma \bar{\normalise}t',\sigma'$
  there exists a symbolic execution $t,\sigma''\normalise t'',\sigma''',\phi$.
\end{lemma}


\begin{lemma}[Completeness of striding]
  \label{lem:completeStride}
  $\forall t,\sigma$ such that $t,\sigma \bar{\stride}t',\sigma'$
  there exists a symbolic execution $t,\sigma''\eval t'',\sigma''',\phi$.
\end{lemma}


\begin{lemma}[Completeness of evaluation]
  \label{lem:completeEval}
  $\forall e,\sigma$ such that $t,\sigma \bar{\eval}v,\sigma'$
  there exists a symbolic execution $t,\sigma''\eval v',\sigma''',\phi$.
\end{lemma}


Proof for \cref{lem:completeNormalise,lem:completeStride,lem:completeEval} is trivial,
since every concrete execution in these semantics is also a symbolic one.
