One of the classical methods of proving partial correctness of programs is Hoare's axiomatic approach \cite{Hoare1969}, which is based on pre- and postconditions.
See \citet{NielsonN1992} for a nice introduction to the topic.
The axiomatic approach is usually applied to imperative programs, requires manually stating loop invariants, and manually carrying out proofs.

Some work has been done to bring the axiomatic method to functional programming.
The current state of SMT solving allows for automated extraction and solving of a large amount of proof obligations.
Notable works in this field are for example the Hoare Type Theory by \citet{NanevskiMB2006}, the Hoare and Dijkstra Monads by \citet{NanevskiMSGB08, SwamyWSCL2013}, or the Hoare logic for the state monad by \citet{Swierstra2009}.

The difference between the work cited here and our work is that the axiomatic method focuses on stateful computations, while we try to incorporate input as well.
