One of the classical methods of proving partial correctness of programs is Hoare's axiomatic approach \cite{Hoare1969}, which is based on pre- and postconditions.
See \citet{NielsonN1992} for a nice introduction to the topic.
The axiomatic approach is usually applied to imperative programs, requires manually stating loop invariants, and manually carrying out proofs.

The biggest issue for bringing the axiomatic method to functional programming is that higher-order functions require higher-order logic.

\item Hoare monad
\item Dijkstra monad
